            <p >Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will 
                look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", 
                and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.</p>
            <p class="marked"> <mark> What is JAVASCRIPT ?</mark> </p>
            <p >JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else
            . ( not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
            <p class="marked"> <mark> what is JavaScript doing on your page</mark> </p>
            <h3>Browser Security </h3>
            <p >Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website. This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.</p>
            <h3>Javascript running order</h3>
            <p >When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order,
                 from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. </p>
            <h3>Interpreted versus compiled code</h3>
            <p >JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called just-in-time compiling to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language,
                 since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.</p></div>
                 <h1>JavaScript objects</h1>
                 <p class="marked" id="deuxieme_h1"> <mark>  Object basics</mark> </p>
                 <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

                    To begin with, make a local copy of our oojs.html file. This contains very little — a ....script> element for us to write our source code into. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object syntax. While working with this example you should have your developer tools JavaScript console open and ready to type in some commands.
                    
                    As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable.</p>
                 <p class="marked"> <mark> What is this?</mark> </p>
                 <p>In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

                  Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
                  
                  The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In an object method, this refers to the object.</li>
                      <li>Alone, this refers to the global object.</li>
                      <li>In a function, this refers to the global object.</li>
                      <li>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.</li>
                      <li>Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.</li>
                  </ul>
                 <h1>classes in JavaScript</h1>
                 <p class="marked"> <mark> What is a class in Js ?</mark> </p>
                 <p>A JavaScript class is not an object.

                  It is a template for JavaScript objects.</p>
                 <p class="marked"> <mark>   The Constructor Method</mark> </p>
               
                  <p id="troixieme_h1">  The constructor method is a special method:

It has to have the exact name "constructor"
It is executed automatically when a new object is created
It is used to initialize object properties
If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.</p>
<p class="marked"> <mark>  Class Methods</mark> </p> 
  <p> Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

Use the keyword class to create a class.

Always add a constructor() method.

Then add any number of methods.</p>
